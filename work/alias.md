Alias is words game I play with my friends on a weekly basis.
Since there wasn't any app made for iPhone users that has Croatian dictionary, I decided to try and create one on a universal platform - WEB.

Game is coming closer to its beta stage and when the time comes to hit beta, I'll post link to it here and in a new blog post of course.

I tried to create this whole app without touching Redux and as far as I'm concerned it worked pretty well, even though I'm gonna learn Redux for my next project as I would like to have one store for whole app rather than this way.
