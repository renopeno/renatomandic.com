I decided to work on a weather app to practice usage of public APIs and React at the same time. It's all new to me, but [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)  helps to get started much more easily with that framework.

I haven't yet started learning Redux or anything for managing states in my apps as I have to familiarize myself more with React at this time.

This app works by writing a city and country in text field and it get's you forecast for next few days as well as current temperature in separated box.

I enjoyed working on it and can't wait to get started on next React component.
