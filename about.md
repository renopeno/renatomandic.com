Hello, I'm **Renato**, 25 years old guy living in Croatia.

####  Front end development

I've been part of Web development world for about a year now and I love every day I spend my time learning about it. I like **React** the most. I just enjoy putting together different components and making an app out of them. It's like playing Tetris or playing with Legos.

#### Design

I like colors. I like gradients. Oh boy, I really like gradients. Someone has Facebook, someone likes Instagram..
<br>I <span style="color: #EC5796; font-weight:bold;"><3</span> Dribbble. 

####  Freelance

I'm a freelance graphic designer working for a few clients on a daily basis. Even though I enjoy working with them, my main goal is to get hired as a Front end developer in a digital agency in a near future.

#### Goals for 2017

My wishes for this year are simple. I want to get hired as (front end) developer so I can start hanging out with others I share interests with. I want to learn more, learn from others, become better developer and work on great and interesting projects.

#### Gaming

Gaming is one of the biggest parts of my life. I enjoy playing online games competing with other people. Games I enjoy the most are Counter Strike, Overwatch and Fifa.
