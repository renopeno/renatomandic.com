Hello, I'm **Renato**, 25 years old guy living in Croatia.

#### 🖥  Front end development

I've been part of Web development world for about a year now and I'm loving every day I spend my time learning about it. I enjoy reading web blogs, spending time watching videos on YouTube and reading JavaScript books.

#### ⌨️ Freelancer

I'm a freelance graphic designer working for a few clients on a daily basis. Even though I enjoy working with them, my main goal is to get hired as a Front end developer in a digital agency in a near future.

#### 💡 Goals for 2017

My wishes for this year are simple. I want to get hired as (front end) developer so I can start hanging out with others I share interests with. I want to learn more, learn from others, become better developer and work on great and interesting projects.

#### 🕹 Gaming

Gaming is one of the biggest parts of my life. I enjoy playing online games competing with other people. Games I enjoy the most are Counter Strike, Overwatch and Fifa.
